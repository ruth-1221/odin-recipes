Food is more than just sustenance; it's a journey. This repository is a collection of my favorite recipes, 
a place to share the dishes that have brought joy to my kitchen. Built with a focus on pure HTML, 
this project showcases how you can create a clean recipe site using the foundational building block of the web. 
Whether you're a seasoned chef or a curious begginner, I hope you find something here to inspire your next meal.
